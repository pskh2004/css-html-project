My First Website using HTML & CSS
Description
This project is my first attempt at building a personal website using HTML and CSS. The website introduces myself and showcases my skills, experience, education, and personal quotes. The layout incorporates an interactive, responsive design with hover effects, animations, and modal windows for an enhanced user experience. It also includes a simple navigation system, making it easy for users to jump between sections.

Features
Responsive Background Image: A fixed background image covers the entire screen, creating a clean and professional look.
Smooth Navigation: Buttons for scrolling to the top and bottom of the page ensure smooth navigation between sections.
Modal Window: A modal window pops up when clicking "About Me," providing additional details about me.
Hover Effects: Hover effects are applied to various sections, such as the menu, about section, and quotes, creating a dynamic interaction for users.
Animated Experience Section: When hovering over the "My Experience" section, the background color smoothly transitions, and the card scales up slightly.
Expandable Menu: The content section contains links to different parts of the page, including experience, motivation, education, and a special "Golden Text" quote.
Sections
About Me: An introduction with my name, origin, and a brief bio.
Experience: Insights into my experience and philosophy on self-improvement.
Motivation: A motivational quote to inspire users.
Education: Information about my education and current academic pursuits.
Golden Text: A special quote that reflects my coding philosophy.
Footer: A link to my GitHub profile where users can explore more of my work.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structuring the content of the website.
CSS: Styling the website, adding hover effects, animations, and modals.
Images: Several images are used for buttons and background to enhance visual appeal.

Content Expansion: The site can be expanded with additional sections, blog posts, and projects.
